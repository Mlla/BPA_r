Description: This model estimates the fishing mortality and Spawning Potential Ratio (SPR) by a statistical analysis of several length frequencies of catches (LFC) simultaneously. The model works under the equilibrium conditions assumption and its estimates correspond to an average of years period reflected in analyzed LFCs.
